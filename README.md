# Discord-Bots-with-Python-3.13

### Important things you need to know:
### There is a YT-Tutorial for everthing -> Just use this Link: 
0. Download the files as a .zip
1. The bot is made with this code only for one Discord bot/server -> This is because you have to enter the respective Guild_ID of the server, which makes the / commands load faster
2. You need to create a bot in the Discord-Developer-Portal and set it up the way you want. Under "oauth2" You need to give it "Bot" and "application.commands" in "Scopes" and then in "Bot Permissions", "Administrator".
2. You need to download VSC
3. If you downloaded the files as ZIP you have to unzip them all into a folder in Explorer (name it like "Discordbot1")
4. You have to open the code in VSC, fill in all open fields (it says so everywhere) and then start it via the terminal
5. You must enter your bot token that you created via the Discord developer portal in the .env file 
6. You also have to add all intents to the Discord developer portal (this is located under "Bot" in the left bar from the DC-Dev.-Port.)

===========================================================================

8. The code is not perfect, but simple and easy to understand
9. The code is always editable and upgradeable
10. The code may be published, but preferably with credits

### Have fun with him :)
