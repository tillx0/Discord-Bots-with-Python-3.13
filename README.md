# Discord-Bots-with-Python-3.13
### Here are all my public Discord Bots, coded with Python 3.13.

### Important things you need to know:
- The bot is made with this code only for one Discord bot/server -> This is because you have to enter the respective Guild_ID of the server, which makes the / commands load faster
- The code is not perfect, but simple and easy to understand
- The code is always editable and upgradeable
- The code may be published, but preferably with credits

### Have fun with him :)
